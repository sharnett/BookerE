Quick start:
1) get django: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
2) get pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
("easy_install pip" worked for me)
3) get cloudmailin: pip install django-cloudmailin
4) get BookerE: git clone git@github.com:jackdreilly/BookerE.git
5) go to main directory: cd BookerE/bookere/
6) set up database: python manage.py syncdb
7) run it: python manage.py runserver


WHAT THE FINISHED PROJECT WILL DO

1) Users sign up with an email and password.
2) Can add/remove a borrow/loan record via email or a web form.
3) Receive a regular report (say, every two weeks) of which books you are borrowing/loaning.
Can also see this report at any time with a special email, or on the website.
Can adjust the frequency of the report somehow.
4) Can see a history of books that have been returned already, again via email or web.
